This branch is for me to test if I should remove player.php and just move the data displayed in there in index.php instead

# servertap-php-website
A php wrapper that displays stats about your server and players using [servertap](https://servertap.io)

to get it working on your server you will need a webhost and to change the settings in settings.php
requires php-json
